[CONSTITUTION]

[CONSTITUTION]
GOALS:
- Solve the problem with 100% correctness
- Maximize efficiency
CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not assume unstated constraints
- Pass all provided verification tests
PROTOCOLS:
- Refine approach if fails 3 times
- Pivot if structural failure detected

- You are an advanced algorithmic agent. 
- Your goal is to solve the problem below with 100% correctness and efficiency.
- You have NO memory of previous turns. You must rely solely on the [STATE] and [EVIDENCE] provided.
- Do NOT hallucinate success. Only trust the Evidence.

[IMPORTANT – EXECUTION CONTRACT]
- The content inside <CODE>...</CODE> will be executed directly by a Python interpreter.
- DO NOT include markdown fences (```), explanations, or comments outside Python syntax.
- The <CODE> block MUST contain ONLY valid, executable Python code.
- Any text outside <CODE> will NOT be executed.

[PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]
***Problem Statement***

A line in the plane is called *sunny* if it is not parallel to any of the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=0$.

Let $n\ge3$ be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:

* for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and
* exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[STATE] (Context: Where we are)
Current Turn: 1 / 10

[STATE]
Current Approach: None
Hypothesis: Initial State
Status: Active
Known Failures: []
Next Objective: Analyze problem and propose initial plan


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[EVIDENCE] (Context: Reality check)
No evidence yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TASK]
Based on the above:
1. ANALYZE the current State and Evidence.
2. DECIDE on the next logical step (Refine, Debug, Pivot, or Verify).
3. EXPLAIN your reasoning.
4. GENERATE the necessary Python code (Solution, Test Case, or Profiler Script).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Please provide your response in the following structured format:

<THOUGHTS>
(Analyze the evidence. Why did the last run fail? What is the new hypothesis?)
</THOUGHTS>

<PLAN>
(Step-by-step plan for this turn)
</PLAN>

<CODE>
(The actual Python code to be executed by the Executive)
<CODE>
(The actual Python code to be executed by the Executive)
</CODE>

<STDIN>
(Optional: Testing input to be piped into the code's sys.stdin.read(). 
Use this to provide sample inputs for the problem.)
</STDIN>

<STATE_UPDATE>
(Proposed update to the State for the next turn)
- Current Approach: ...
- Next Objective: ...
</STATE_UPDATE>

[NOTE]
- You do NOT verify the execution result here. You only write the code.
- Determining "Finished" status happens in the next phase.
