    "Turn 1 Logic:\n[THOUGHTS]\n*   The problem asks for the minimum number of multiplications by 2 to make a given subarray $A_l, \\dots, A_r$ non-decreasing.\n    *   Let $c_i$ be the number of multiplications on $A_i$. The greedy strategy for a range $[l, r]$ is:\n        $c_l = 0$\n        $c_i = \\max(0, c_{i-1} + h_i)$ for $i > l$, where $h_i = \\lceil \\log_2(A_{i-1}/A_i) \\rceil$.\n    *   This recurrence can be rewritten using prefix sums of $h_i$. Let $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^i h_j$ (with $h_1=0$).\n        Then $c_k = S_k - \\min_{l \\le j \\le k} S_j$ for $k \\in [l, r]$.\n    *   The total number of operations $f(l, r)$ is $\\sum_{k=l}^r (S_k - \\min_{l \\le j \\le k} S_j) = (\\sum_{k=l}^r S_k) - (\\sum_{k=l}^r \\min_{l \\le j \\le k} S_j)$.\n    *   We can calculate $\\sum_{k=l}^r S_k$ using prefix sums.\n    *   To calculate $\\sum_{k=l}^r \\min_{l \\le j \\le k} S_j$, we use the fact that $\\min_{l \\le j \\le k} S_j$ is a step function.\n    *   We can precompute the first $j > i$ such that $S_j < S_i$ (let's call it $next\\_smaller[i]$) using a stack.\n    *   The step function can then be traversed using binary lifting (doubling).\n    *   Complexity: $O((N+Q) \\log N)$ time and $O(N \\log N)$ space. This should pass within the time and memory limits for $N, Q = 2.5 \\times 10^5$.\n[PLAN]\n1.  Read $N, Q$ and the sequence $A$.\n2.  Calculate $h_i = \\lceil \\log_2(A_{i-1}/A_i) \\rceil$ for $i=2, \\dots, N$ and $h_1 = 0$.\n3.  Compute prefix sums $S_i$ of $h_i$ and prefix sums $PS_i$ of $S_i$.\n4.  Compute $next\\_smaller[i]$, the first $j > i$ such that $S_j < S_i$, using a stack.\n5.  Build binary lifting tables `up[K][N+2]` and `sum_up[K][N+2]`:\n    *   `up[0][i] = next_smaller[i]`\n    *   `sum_up[0][i] = (next_smaller[i] - i) * S_i`\n    *   `up[k][i] = up[k-1][up[k-1][i]]`\n    *   `sum_up[k][i] = sum_up[k-1][i] + sum_up[k-1][up[k-1][i]]`\n6.  For each query $(l, r)$:\n    *   Calculate $ans = PS_r - PS_{l-1} - \\text{sum of step function}$.\n    *   The sum of the step function is found by jumping through the `up` and `sum_up` tables as long as the jumps stay within $[l, r]$.\n    *   Handle the final part of the range.\n7.  Output all results.\n\n[EXECUTION LOG]\nRunning sanitized code...\nExecution timed out!\n"
