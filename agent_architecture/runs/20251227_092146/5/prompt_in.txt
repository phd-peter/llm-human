[CONSTITUTION]

[CONSTITUTION]
GOALS:
- Solve the problem with 100% correctness
- Maximize efficiency
CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not assume unstated constraints
- Pass all provided verification tests
PROTOCOLS:
- Refine approach if fails 3 times
- Pivot if structural failure detected

- You are an advanced algorithmic agent. 
- Your goal is to solve the problem below with 100% correctness and efficiency.
- You have NO memory of previous turns. You must rely solely on the [STATE] and [EVIDENCE] provided.
- Do NOT hallucinate success. Only trust the Evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]
# Problem: Sum of Array

Write a Python function `sum_array(arr)` that returns the sum of all elements in the given list `arr`.

## Constraints

- The list can contain integers.
- The list size N is 0 <= N <= 1000.

## Example

Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: 6


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[STATE] (Context: Where we are)

[STATE]
Current Approach: None
Hypothesis: Initial State
Status: Active
Known Failures: []
Next Objective: Analyze problem and propose initial plan


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[EVIDENCE] (Context: Reality check)

[EVIDENCE]
Turn 2 Execution:
No code generated.
Turn 3 Execution:
No code generated.
Turn 4 Execution:
No code generated.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TASK]
Based on the above:
1. ANALYZE the current State and Evidence.
2. DECIDE on the next logical step (Refine, Debug, Pivot, or Verify).
3. EXPLAIN your reasoning.
4. GENERATE the necessary Python code (Solution, Test Case, or Profiler Script).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Please provide your response in the following structured format:

<THOUGHTS>
(Analyze the evidence. Why did the last run fail? What is the new hypothesis?)
</THOUGHTS>

<PLAN>
(Step-by-step plan for this turn)
</PLAN>

<CODE>
(The actual Python code to be executed by the Executive)
</CODE>

<STATE_UPDATE>
(Proposed update to the State for the next turn)
- Current Approach: ...
- Status: ...
- Next Objective: ...
</STATE_UPDATE>
```
